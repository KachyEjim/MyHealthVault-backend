"""Since you're building an API using Flask and JWT for authentication, and you're aiming to send notifications to users without access to the browser (possibly via a mobile app or a different platform), the best approach would be to use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** directly from your server.

To achieve this:

1. **FCM Token Management**: Even though you don't have access to the browser, you need the FCM token generated by the client (mobile app, web app, etc.) to identify the device that will receive the notification.
   
   - **Mobile App**: The FCM token will typically be generated by the mobile app (iOS/Android). The mobile app should send this token to your Flask API, and your server can store this token for each user.
   
   - **API**: Once the FCM token is sent to your API by the client (mobile app), store it in your database against the authenticated user.

2. **Server-Side Notification**: From your Flask API, you can use Firebase's Admin SDK to send notifications to users based on the FCM tokens stored in your backend.

### Steps to Implement:

#### 1. Install Firebase Admin SDK in Flask
First, install the Firebase Admin SDK in your Flask app environment:

```bash
pip install firebase-admin
```

#### 2. Set up Firebase Admin SDK
Download your Firebase project service account private key from the Firebase Console. Save it as a JSON file and load it into your Flask app.

Here’s how to initialize Firebase Admin SDK in your Flask app:

```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, messaging

# Path to your Firebase service account JSON key file
cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/your/firebase-service-account-key.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
```

#### 3. Store the FCM Token
When the user logs in to your mobile app and receives the FCM token, send that token to your Flask API, and associate it with the authenticated user.

Here’s an example route in Flask to store the token:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required, get_jwt_identity
from your_database_models import User  # Import your User model

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/save-fcm-token', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def save_fcm_token():
    user_id = get_jwt_identity()  # Get the authenticated user's ID from JWT
    fcm_token = request.json.get('fcm_token')

    if not fcm_token:
        return jsonify({"error": "FCM token is required"}), 400

    # Save the FCM token for the user in the database
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    if user:
        user.fcm_token = fcm_token
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({"message": "FCM token saved successfully"}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found"}), 404
```

In this case, you are assuming that your `User` model has an `fcm_token` field. Here’s an example of how the `User` model might look:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    fcm_token = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=True)  # FCM token field
```

#### 4. Send Notification from Flask
Once you have the FCM token stored, you can send a notification to the user using the `messaging` API from Firebase Admin SDK.

Here’s an example of how you can send a notification:

```python
def send_fcm_notification(fcm_token, title, body):
    # Construct the message payload
    message = messaging.Message(
        notification=messaging.Notification(
            title=title,
            body=body
        ),
        token=fcm_token,
    )

    # Send the notification
    try:
        response = messaging.send(message)
        print('Successfully sent message:', response)
    except firebase_admin.exceptions.FirebaseError as e:
        print('Error sending message:', e)
```

You can trigger this function when an event happens (like a status update or a new message):

```python
@app.route('/notify-user', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def notify_user():
    user_id = get_jwt_identity()  # Get the user ID from the JWT token
    user = User.query.get(user_id)

    if not user or not user.fcm_token:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found or FCM token missing"}), 404

    # Notification content
    title = request.json.get('title')
    body = request.json.get('body')

    # Send FCM notification
    send_fcm_notification(user.fcm_token, title, body)

    return jsonify({"message": "Notification sent"}), 200
```

In this example:
- **`/save-fcm-token`** is an endpoint where the mobile app sends the FCM token to be saved in the backend.
- **`/notify-user`** is an endpoint where you send notifications to the user by using the stored FCM token.

#### 5. Client-Side Implementation (Mobile App)
In the mobile app (Android/iOS), you'll use Firebase to get the FCM token and send it to your Flask API. For example, in Android:

```java
FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().getToken()
    .addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<String>() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<String> task) {
            if (!task.isSuccessful()) {
                Log.w(TAG, "Fetching FCM registration token failed", task.getException());
                return;
            }

            // Get new FCM registration token
            String token = task.getResult();

            // Send the token to your server
            sendTokenToServer(token);
        }
    });
```

Make sure to call your Flask `/save-fcm-token` endpoint after retrieving the token.

### Conclusion
- The **client** (mobile app or another platform) generates the FCM token and sends it to your Flask backend.
- The **Flask API** stores this token against the user.
- You use Firebase Admin SDK in your Flask API to send notifications to that FCM token whenever necessary.

This setup allows you to send notifications from your Flask API to a user’s device, even if you don’t have access to the browser. Let me know if you need more specific code or further guidance on any part!"""
